# v3.9.0 Remediation Log

**Version:** 3.9.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** No remediations required

---

## Summary

No remediation actions were needed for v3.9.0 release closure.

All 33 gates passed on final run. All 523 unit tests passed.
Both dual-pass scorers converged at 496/500 with zero variance.

## Transient Issues (resolved during development, not release-blocking)

1. **Transient gate failure during orchestrated runs** (Epic 1 development)
   - Root cause: resource contention from 28 sequential subprocess spawns
   - Fix: `always_retry=True` for inherited gates in gate-v39.py
   - Status: RESOLVED, not present in final run

2. **Single transient test failure on first final gate run** (522/523)
   - Root cause: same subprocess contention pattern
   - Resolution: Second run passed 523/523 cleanly
   - Status: RESOLVED, not a code defect
