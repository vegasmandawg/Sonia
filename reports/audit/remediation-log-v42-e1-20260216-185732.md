# v4.2 E1 Remediation Log

Generated: 20260216-185732

## Issues Encountered

1. **memory_mutation_policy.py erroneous import**: Line `from frozenset import *` was a hallucinated import. Removed immediately.
2. **Missing FrozenSet import**: `FrozenSet` type hint used but not imported from typing. Added to import line.

## Resolution

Both issues fixed before test execution. No test failures attributable to these issues.

## Final Status

- E1 gate: 10/10 PASS
- E1 tests: 70/70 PASS (budget: >=30)
- Full matrix: 45/45 PROMOTE
- Unit test floor: 823/753
