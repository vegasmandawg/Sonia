Phase 3 Python Environment Diagnostic
=====================================
Timestamp: 2026-02-09 10:35:00

BLOCKER IDENTIFIED: Windows 11 App Execution Aliases redirecting python.exe

Status:
- where python: C:\Users\iamth\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe
- python --version: "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store..."
- This is NOT a real Python installation - it's a Windows alias

Root Cause:
Windows 11 has App Execution Aliases that redirect python.exe to Microsoft Store installer instead of actual Python binary.

Solution:
1. Remove python alias from Settings > Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases
   - Uncheck "python.exe" and "python3.exe"
2. Install Python 3.10+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Verify: python --version (should show actual version, not alias)

OR Alternative:
Use explicit path or installer-based Python from:
- Winget: winget install Python.Python.3.12
- Chocolatey: choco install python

Gates Cannot Execute:
- Gate 1: Blocked (services require Python)
- Gate 2: Blocked (depends on Gate 1)
- Gate 3: Blocked (depends on Gate 2)
- Gate 4: Blocked (depends on Gate 3)
- Gate 5: Blocked (depends on Gate 4)
- Release: Blocked (depends on all gates)

Evidence of Blocker:
- Prerequisite check: FAILED
- Python resolution: FAILED
- venv creation: SKIPPED (no Python)
- Dependency installation: SKIPPED (no Python)
- Preflight validation: SKIPPED (no Python)

Timeline to Unblock:
1. Disable Python alias in Settings: ~2 minutes
2. Install Python 3.10+ from python.org: ~5-10 minutes
3. Verify installation: ~1 minute
4. Rerun phase3-prereq.ps1: ~30 minutes (first run, dependency install)
5. Execute Gate 1: ~1 hour

Total estimated: 45-60 minutes from now

Documentation:
This blocker is specific to Windows 11 environment configuration and does not affect the Phase 3 framework or test infrastructure. Once Python is properly installed, prerequisites can be completed and Gate 1 execution can begin immediately.

Next Action:
1. Disable Python App Execution Alias in Windows Settings
2. Install Python 3.10+ from official source with PATH enabled
3. Rerun: .\phase3-prereq.ps1
4. Proceed directly to Gate 1
